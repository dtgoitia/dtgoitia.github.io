BIM o not to BIM, that's the question, apparently in my environment.

I have had a interesting conversation with some colleagues. Topic: BIM. I will skip the definition of BIM. If it's the first time you listen this concept, I invite you to do a quick search, you will find tones of information.

As a passionate of new technologies and their use to maximize every process efficiency, I understand BIM as the entry door to a digital society, to a huge world of possibilities to redefine the construction industry.

&nbsp;

Before jumping into details, I would like to make a short reflection.

Industrial revolution, data revolution &gt;

We want faster accessible data. Why? Efficiency.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Other industries, such as automotive industry, long time ago implemented this sort of methodologies. The technology is out there, we just need to use it. In fact, the concept of BIM it's been around for quite a while.

Personally, the more I learn <a href="https://davidtorralbablog.wordpress.com/2016/10/22/autocad-net-api-the-next-step-towards-efficiency/">C#</a>, more I see the relationship between BIM methodology technology/products and object programming languages.

During our conversation, my colleagues suggested BIM was just a new toy, a new fashion. Something the UK government asks (without any reason?).

"What is the point of issuing a 3D (or 4D, 5D...) model to the client? What is the point of issuing a 3D design on site? Labour don't use tablets, they use paper." That's true. Furthermore, paper is cheap, easy to fold it into a pocket and open it when necessary, and does not run off battery power. Good value for service, isn't it?

However, I believe this approach is too narrow and simplistic.z e

I think nowadays my colleagues are definitely right. <strong>However</strong>, let's go back in time. Despite I am young enough not to have seen this engineering technology stage, before computers arrived everything was done on paper right? How many people were needed to draw a layout? And today? Just a computer and a printer.

How many jobs has the printer destroyed? For sure loads of drawing technicians lost

A 3D+ model allows easier chain manufacturing to later build fast on site, or even automatized building later on with automation.

Big data around standard and complex 3d models for better business and economic decisions.

Companies and governments need information to take decisions, specially at large scale.
