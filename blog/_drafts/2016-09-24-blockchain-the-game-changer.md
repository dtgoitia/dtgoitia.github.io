Health, security, currency, copyright... these are just some of the possibilities of this not very known concept called <i>blockchain</i>. But, first things first, what is it?

****** REVISAR:

<i>Blockchain</i> is a technology which allows us to blabala sin depender de un nodo central.

Central node?

Nowadays we rely on central authorities (Google, Facebook, Amazon...). They are central because they store the data in their servers, and you access that data from your device with your user and password. But, hey, hold on! I have quite important information in Google, don't you!? What about Amazon??! They keep my card details!!! Well, as said, we are trusting them. I am not saying we shouldn't, but <i>blockchain</i> gives us the possibility to move this data from their servers into our devices.

So, keeping it simple, <i>blockchain</i> provides us a very safe and private way of keeping our information.

Anyway, KEEP CALM and TAKE A LOOK to Don Tapscott's TED Talk, on June 2016 (fresh!).

One of the first thing it came to my mind was 'right, we have all <i>Bitcoin</i> transactions in a single file, so... sh*t! That file must be gigantic!'. Correct. The file is huge. After researching online I found most people turn to Moore's law to answer this issue. Personally, I am a bit sceptic about that answer, but who knows, I am not an IT.

In any case, there are many other applications, like Mycelia. Based on <i>blockchain</i>, Imogen Heap is building a system where any musician can get paid when their music is played, leaving to a side the money-draining middleman. What about medical data storage? That topic sound's much more serious.

What we can't deny is the vast amount of possibilities this concepts brings in.

Huge potential. How long will it take to this concept to burst into our day by day lives? Can't wait for it!
