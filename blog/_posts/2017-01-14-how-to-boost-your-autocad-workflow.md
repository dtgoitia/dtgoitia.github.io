If you are reading this post you are probably an AutoCAD user who wants to improve its drafting performance.

There are basically 2 wayls to speed up your AutoCAD workflow:

1. **Delegate**. It might be worth to delegate drafting tasks to a specialised professional.
    * Pros: **forget** about the process problems, just detail the desired output and it will be done for you.
    * Cons: you need to **pay**.
2. **Automate**. AutoCAD offers many ways to automate tasks: macros, custom commands, plug-ins...
    * Pros: once built they are **forever**.
    * Cons: you need to **know** how to code.

I know what are you thinking _hold on, hold on... what are you suggesting? ¬¬ I don't have time to learn to program and in my situation is not worth it to hire nobody to draw for me._

Here my proposal: **delegate the automation**. It will probably require a bigger starting cost, but you will recover the initial investment as you produce faster. Remember: an automation is forever.
