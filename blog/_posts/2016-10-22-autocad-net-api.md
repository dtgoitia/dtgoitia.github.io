I published not so long ago a post about <a href="https://davidtorralbablog.wordpress.com/2016/10/03/autolisp-scripting-in-autocad/">scripting in <i>AutoCAD</i></a> to boost your productivity. Scripting is great! You don't need to set up anything, <i>AutoCAD</i> is enough to start doing magic. And is pretty easy to update and test your code. Actually, the experience of discover and learn <i>AutoLISP</i> and <i>VLISP</i> during this year it has been amazing. However, the more scripts I was building, the more limitations I was finding, such as create custom objects.

So, a step towards a more powerful tool was unavoidable. <i>.NET</i> had to happen, in my case with <i>C#</i> (or <i>CSharp</i>). Why not <i>VisualBasic</i>? Why not <i>ObjectARX </i>(<i>C++</i> based)? Well, despite I have played a bit with <i>VisualBasic</i> before to create some Macros, and I had some relation with C++, as I spent couple of years building <i>Expert Advisors</i> for <i>MetraTrader</i> with <i>MQL4</i> and <i>MQL5</i>, I think <i>C#</i> is the best option to start. "Alright David, but you haven't told us why...¬¬" Okey...okey! I basically looked for professional advice, a friend within the industry. The answer was straight and without any doubt <i>C#</i>.

So, here we are. After 2 weeks reading about <i>C#</i>, classes - I still don't understand how could I write any code till today without knowing what was a class...-, namespaces, inheritance and a whole bunch of new and very interesting concepts, I took <i>Visual Studio 2015</i> and created my first command <i>AutoCAD 2017</i> (eh, debug included!).

I can't wait to learn more and create my super cool drafting stuff!
