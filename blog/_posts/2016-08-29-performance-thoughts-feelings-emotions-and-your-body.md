Yesterday I found this video between my "Watch later" list and gave it a go:

Originally titled as <em>Being Brilliant Every Single Day</em> (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q06YIWCR2Js" target="_blank">part 1</a>,  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_fFattg8N0" target="_blank">part 2</a>), this talk took place at TEDxPortsmouth event (March 2012). The speaker -Dr. Alan Watkins- is the founder and CEO of <a href="http://www.complete-coherence.com/" target="_blank">Complete Coherence</a>, recognised as an international expert on leadership and human performance, among others.

The talk was so interesting I kept on looking for more recent information about it and found <em>Why you feel what you feel</em>, at TEDxOxford event (January, 2015):

Interesting field to keep on growing isn't it?
